- mongodb = database - nosql database
- more traditional database = relational
- mongo - each database can contain 1 or more collections (tables)
- each collection can contain one or more data structures - documents (rows)
- each document contains information about one single entity, for example 
one blog post, one review, one user etc
- collection is like the parents structure containing all the documents
- document has a data format that looks a lot like json.
